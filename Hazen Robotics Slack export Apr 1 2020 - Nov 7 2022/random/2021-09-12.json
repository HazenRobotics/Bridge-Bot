Some of you are cleared to start practicing tomorrow and some are waiting for physicals or just to be cleared by Ms. Olson. I just wanted to let you know that we are currently playing at McKnight until the end of the month when our brand new courts are complete. There is a bus for students who need it. Those players should quickly change after school and meet the bus out in front of the school at 2:15. It should be a short bus and come after the other busses are gone.\nStudents need 10 practices to be eligible to play a match, so I am attaching the schedule. On the days there isn’t a match, there will be practice and when JV has a match at home, we will try to run a short practice before the match. There may also be a Saturday practice or two to try to get you eligible.\n \nWe are looking forward to meeting you and hope you are out soon! Please respond to this email just to confirm that you are still planning to play. I need to know how many uniforms we need.\n \nIf you are unclear of your status, check with Ms. Olson in the main office or at <tel:4252044250|425-204-4250>.\n \nThank you!\nGail Ellis\nTennis coach\n\nGoodbye robotics club we'll be back at the end of October :pensive:",
