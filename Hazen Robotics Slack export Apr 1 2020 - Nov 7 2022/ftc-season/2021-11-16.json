The facilities were great! \nI also want to thank Ken Luthy, the “blue” referee and Regina Grubb, our scorekeeper. \nI look forward to the next league meet, December 11th. Again, it will be at Stewart Middle School.  \n• Please plan on arriving at 9:00 AM \n• Plan on matches (cross your fingers – all the bugs are worked out) starting at 10:00 AM \n• Each team will play another 6 matches. \n• There should be a practice field available at this upcoming league meet \n",
