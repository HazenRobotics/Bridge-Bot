I registered for it this year and if anyone is interested in making a team with me, all you need to do is register on their website and then join the team. I think up to 4 people can join a team, or you could participate independently. Programming is done in Java, but a very large element of the game is strategy, so its not all about programming.\n<https:\/\/battlecode.org\/>",
