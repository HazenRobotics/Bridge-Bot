                "text": "The Oasis chassis is something that I designed over summer break while I was grieving the loss of FTC (It&rsquo;s so sad to not have FTC&hellip;) Every year we spent too little time designing the chassis, and we would always have some annoying problem with it during the season. With ring it up, we sadly discovered that our omni wheels couldn&rsquo;t hurdle&nbsp;an object on the playing field. Similarly, before&nbsp;we put mecanum wheels on Sheila, she had a terrible two-wheel drive that would often skid around. So even though I&rsquo;m not participating in FTC anymore, I decided to go ahead and make a chassis that I liked while I was waiting for college to start.\n\nMy first version just focused on the drivetrain. I wanted a flexible drivetrain that could be easily modified (I designed this before the game release). I used sprockets and chains along with plates with multiple holes for the axles. This way, I could switch around the sprockets for different speeds and I could raise or lower the wheels to get over higher objects.\n\nAfter designing the Oasis, I laser-cut pieces of HDF for test plates on the side. I also used my VEX Mecanum Wheel adapters on the Mecanum wheels. I then tested the chassis and developed my mecanum drive and superdrive tasks on it. I&rsquo;ll talk about these in a later article, or you can just look at them on github.\nAfter making sure that the drivetrain worked well, I designed a second version of the Oasis that incorporated more mounting points and a stronger frame.\n       Final isometric view          View of bottom &ndash; notice the custom supports             Half-raised six-bar lift          40&Prime; when raised, but this could be extended to 50&Prime;          Lowered six-bar lift          A work in progress photo with tetrix c channel       \nAs a finishing touch, I added a six-bar lift to demonstrate how easily I could attach more components to the chassis. The 80\/20 extrusions on the sides can also be replaced with tetrix c-channels. I never made this version.",
